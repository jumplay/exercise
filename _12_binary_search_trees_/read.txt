The search tree data structure supports many dynamic-set operations, including SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, PREDECESSOR, SUCCESSOR, INSERT, and DELETE.
Basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree.
Different binary search trees can represent the same set of values.
The binary-search-tree property:
	x...left.key <= x.key <= x...right.key
Inorder tree walk:
	print the root of a subtree between printing the values in its left subtree and printing those in its right subtree.
Preorder tree walk:
	print the root before the values in either subtree.
Postorder tree walk:
	print the root after the values in its subtrees.
